# Project Title
Helium Forge

## Project Description
Helium Forge is a Solidity-based smart contract project that simulates a decentralized forging system inspired by helium as a resource. Users can deposit ETH, forge virtual "helium tokens," and withdraw funds. It's built as a simple Ethereum smart contract to demonstrate basic interactions like resource management and token creation.

## Project Vision
To create an accessible, decentralized platform where users can "forge" digital assets in a gamified or resource-based economy, drawing from concepts like mining or crafting in blockchain ecosystems. The vision is to evolve this into a full-fledged dApp for NFT forging or token economies.

## Key Features
- **Deposit ETH**: Users can deposit Ether to build their forging balance.
- **Forge Tokens**: Convert deposited ETH into helium tokens at a 1:1 ratio (modifiable in future versions).
- **Withdraw ETH**: Securely withdraw unused ETH from the contract.
- Basic mapping for balances and tokens to track user state.

## Future Scope
- Integrate ERC-20 or ERC-721 standards for proper token minting and NFTs.
- Add advanced forging mechanics, such as rarity levels, cooldowns, or multi-user collaborations.
- Implement gas optimizations and security audits.
- Develop a frontend dApp (e.g., using React and Web3.js) for user interaction.
- Expand to support real Helium network integrations if applicable (e.g., IoT data oracles).
